# Basic Template

A basic template for having an app where it will play automatically without internet and installation, all in a modern browser (preferably in chrome).

I am going to add indexedDB as a storage and angular for something simple. I may add import / export of the indexedDB stored objects for having a backup.

My goal is to prove how I can replace some old desktop apps where their main thing is some common CRUD and basic functionality "logistic-like" programs.
