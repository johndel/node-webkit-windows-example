# Web app as desktop

I am testing to see how I could create a web app and make it as a desktop. What a desktop app means? It will work locally only, it will keep the data in there. I plan to test some solutions as phonegap and tideSDK, so far I've tested node-webkit and I am impressed. It works on windows, just click on run.bat and it runs.
